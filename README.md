# MoneyManager: Finance Organizer with Python
This is a updated & improved version of the ExpensesManager program. The core functionality of importing bank account movements from .csv-exports, 
tagging the transactions by their purpose/use and summarizing every month on balance sheets as pdf files, remains. However, there are major improvments in
the import functionality, which now only needs the .csv-files to be dropped in a folder. Tagging is also massively improved as the tag associated with the
reference of a transactions is now automatically added to the reference-tag list, which removes the need to repeatedly enter the tag of already known references.
